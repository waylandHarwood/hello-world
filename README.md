# hello-world
This is my first project on Github

I am an emerging front-end programmer, for the past 8 months (since August, 2015) I have been learning about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and JQuery.  I have a thirst for knowledge and I am seeking to start my career as a front end developer.  I have much to learn but I learn something new everyday and I am steadily closing that gap.  I have been mainly doing my personal projects using notepad++ and komodo 9 but thought it would be a good idea to start posting my projects on GitHub for others to see and comment on.  Any constructive comments would be greatly appreciated!
